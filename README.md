# RDE

RDE is a work-in-progress modular desktop environment for GNU/Linux.
Although working on X11 currently, it is intended to adopt Wayland in the near future.

It is designed to perform well on modest hardware, and to be fully modular and easily extensible.
While suitable for desktop use, it is aimed at the media center and gaming demographic.

The core application itself provides the framework for modules to plug into.

Some of the following provided modules are:

- Bluetooth (Manage Bluetooth devices and connections)
- Clock (Provides the time and date. Includes a calendar and setting alarms)
- Launcher (Serves as the taskbar. Easily launch and manage installed applications)
- Media Player (Fully featured media player, including library, playlists and CD ripping support)
- Network (Manage network connections)
- StatsMonitor (Displays configurable system statistics in real-time)
- Terminal (Drop-down terminal)
- Voice (Provides voice notifications text-to-speech support for other modules)
- Gaming (Integrated feature-rich gaming library, launch and manage installed games)
- Display (Allows the screen to display movies, slideshows, screensavers, webcam feeds and so on)
- Web Browser (integrated web browser)

.. and there are many more to come.
